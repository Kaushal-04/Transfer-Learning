# Transfer-Learning
Learn and Practice Transfer Learning Using MobileNetV3

In the field of machine learning, transfer learning is a powerful technique that leverages pre-trained models and applies them to new tasks. This approach allows us to save time and computational resources by reusing the knowledge gained from training on large datasets.

We use MobileNetV3, a convolutional neural network architecture for mobile devices, to train a classifier for the Fashion-MNIST dataset using the PyTorch framework.

Fashion-MNIST is a drop-in replacement for MNIST (images of size 28x28 with 10 classes) but instead of hand-written digits it contains tiny images of clothes!

Steps
1. Load the Fashion-MNIST dataset using the torchvision package.
2. Define a PyTorch model using the MobileNetV3 architecture.
3. Train the model on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
4. Evaluate the model on the test set.
